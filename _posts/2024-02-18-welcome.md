This is the first post on the new Jekyll-based blog.
You can write your posts in Markdown in the `_posts` directory.
Name them dynamically like `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

## Features
- **Markdown support**: Write easily without HTML.
- **Code highlighting**:
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello World")
```
