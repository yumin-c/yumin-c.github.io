**MD candidate, Yonsei University College of Medicine**  

I’m a fourth-year medical student deeply interested in gene editing and therapeutic strategies for rare diseases. I focus on building computational tools that bridge gene editing methods and their translational potential for rare diseases.

In 2023, we developed [***DeepPrime***](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00331-8), a deep learning model designed to accurately predict prime editing outcomes to assist in the design of pegRNAs. Using this, we later applied it to a [**2025 study on *ATM* SNVs**](https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00634-8), enabling comprehensive pathogenicity screening and interpretation of previously uncharacterized variants.

My current focus is on applying deep learning to protein variant interpretation, with the broader aim of improving our understanding of disease-causing mutations and enabling their therapeutic targeting.
